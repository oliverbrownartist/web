    <p style="font-size:medium; line-height:1.4">
      Oliver George-Brown (he/him) is a conceptual artist-composer and scholar originally from Naarm/Melbourne, Australia, and now based in Los Angeles, CA. His intermedia works frequently take the form of sonic-sculptural installations and performance art, often incorporating everyday objects, vernacular media, and interactive technologies. As an openly transgender individual, George-Brown is deeply committed to amplifying the voices and aesthetics of the historically overlooked. This reflects particularly in his prioritisation of mundane, serendipitous aesthetic encounters; as well as his research interests in urban ecologies, Fluxus performance art, and contemporary theories of queerness, relationality, and contingency. George-Brown was the 2020â€”21 Dots+Loops Composition Fellow (Meanjin/Brisbane), and has been released on Remote Telescopes (NY). He holds a BMus in Composition & Music Technology and a BFA (Hons) in sculpture, and is currently pursuing his PhD in Integrated Composition, Improvisation and Technology at the University of California, Irvine.
