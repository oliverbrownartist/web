        <p style="color: #cfba72;">
            Oliver George-Brown (he/him) is a conceptual artist and scholar originally from Naarm/Melbourne, Australia, and now based in Los Angeles, CA. His interdisciplinary, "transecological" works take the form of performance art and sound-sculptural installations, often incorporating everyday objects, vernacular media, and interactive technologies. George-Brown is deeply committed to amplifying the voices and aesthetics of the historically overlooked. This reflects particularly in his prioritisation of mundane, serendipitous aesthetic encounters; as well as his research interests in urban ecologies, Fluxus performance art, and contemporary theories of queerness, relationality, and contingency. George-Brown was the 2020—21 Dots+Loops Composition Fellow (Meanjin/Brisbane), and has been released on Remote Telescopes (NY). He holds a BMus in Composition & Music Technology and a BFA (Hons) in sculpture, and is currently a PhD candidate in Integrated Composition, Improvisation and Technology at the University of California, Irvine.
