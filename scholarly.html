      <p style="color:#cfba72; margin-top:0px">
        <span style="color:#ffffff; font-weight:bold">Abstract:</span> &nbsp <i>Waste Not, Want Not: Transecology and the Sounds of Refuse</i> is a multi-year research project which situates my diverse creative practice in a rigorous conceptual framework. Over the course of my dissertation, I have developed the concept of <b>transecological performance</b> as an attitude towards creative practice which synthesises both queer and ecological thinking. The use of the “trans” prefix highlights the contingent, relational nature of ecological systems-in-time, drawing on theories of queerness and alterity to describe ways of making and performing otherwise. These scholarly lineages also inform my approach to temporality in improvised performance, where I consider how the enforced vulnerability and precarity inherent to experiences of alterity can be more generatively reactivated the course of performance. My dissertation research, both scholarly and creative, explores the polyvalences of <b>refuse</b>; both as physical waste materials, and also as acts of refusal — refusal to conform, refusal to follow predictable creative pathways, refusal to use materials in the ways for which they were intended. In my own creative projects, I practice transecological performance by foregrounding discarded and everyday objects. This contingent, exploratory practice adopts an ethics of care, which I interpret as <i>making</i> the time to <i>take</i> the time to <i>spend</i> time with those beings, human and nonhuman, which we encounter in our everyday environment, but so frequently fail to meaningfully acknowledge. I am interested in the emergent moments of rupture, friction, and absurdity which characterise the quotidian, and which can be deployed in creative works to effect a juxtaposition between the familiar and the unexpected. <i>Waste Not, Want Not</i> is an investigation into ways of making meaning in performance which are both aesthetically compelling and also attuned to processes of production, consumption, usage, and waste in our specific urban-ecological niches.
        <br> <br> <span style="font-size: 0.9em; font-style:italic">Dissertation requirements for the PhD in Integrated Composition, Improvisation & Technology involve both a written scholarly dissertation and a major creative project. I will present works at two upcoming events: my Desert Event (Yucca Valley, CA) in October 2025; and my Urban Event (UC Irvine, CA) in February 2026.</span>
